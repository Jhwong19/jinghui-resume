# Resume building

> This repository allows you to create a professional resume GitHub page using Jekyll. It generates a static HTML page from the `_data/data.yml` file, making it easy to maintain and update your resume in one place.

Simply fork this repository, update the `_data/data.yml` file with your personal information, and GitHub Pages will automatically build your resume site.

Feel free to fork this repository, share it with others, and give it a star if you find it helpful!

## Preview

Below is a preview of how your resume will look after customization:
